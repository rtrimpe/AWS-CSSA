In <a href="https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/aws-certified-solutions-architect-sample-questions-answered-and-discussed/">this amazing post</a> Markos Rendell gave a deep explanation to every single AWS question.

<h2>Passing the AWS solutions architect - Associate exam > Direct experience from AWS Certified members</h2>


Here are some general observations by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihak">Miha Kralj</a> in <a href="https://medium.com/@Miha.Kralj/passing-the-aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-exam-ebbdc26d6598">this great post.</a>

<ul>
<li>There were several questions related to DR solutions with specified RPO/RTO times. Modern cloud-born solutions use completely different BCP approach, but hey, someone in AWS really likes traditional disaster recovery scenarios and is making sure that you love them too. I know it is 2016, but you need to learn the old skool BCP techniques for this exam.</li>

<li>Questions about the AWS Storage Gateway appear at least 3 times. Yeah. Storage Gateway. The stuff that cloud-native architects never saw in action - nor do we want to. You have to learn the difference between Cached Volumes, Stored Volumes and understand how VTL works.</li>

<li>Lots and lots and lots of questions on deployment management. CloudFormation. Elastic Beanstalk. OpsWorks. Learn these three technologies well - not well for an architect, but well for a 2nd-tier escalation operations engineer. One of the examiners really really really liked cloud deployment automation. And now you will like it too. Who cares if you use SaltStack, Terraform or Ansible - learn CF, Beanstalk and OpsWorks!</li>

<li>Networking questions were everywhere, like 30% of the test or even more: VPN/DirectConnect/VPC peering. For me, DDOS protection, WAF, Cloudfront, and SSL/TLS stuff is networking too, although AWS treats them as security issues. Anyway, the examiners *love* networking. Learn networking. I mean, learn it like this is a Cisco exam, not a cloud architecture exam.
Federated access, SAML, IAM roles and all possible AuthZ/AuthN scenarios - learn them all. Learn how IAM policies work. How cross-account trust works. And specifically how they don't work. Think like troubleshooting support personnel and what they need to know about identity flows; that's what you need to know for this exam.</li>

<li>Whenever you see the need for high-performing scalable solution, the answer is always DynamoDB. Even if you think that architecturally there might be a better choice (Cassandra, or CouchDB anyone?), the correct answer will be DynamoDB. People that wrote the test were clearly in love with DynamoDB, Elasticache and Kinesis. Just pick the answer that includes all three of them and you'll be right.</li>

<li>If a scenario is asking for something cheap (cost-effective), the answer must include spot instances, SQS for throttling and perhaps S3 RRS or Glacier.</li>

<li>There were at least two questions where I was simply forced to propose the AWS Data Pipeline. Yeah, the obscure and rarely-seen Data Pipeline service, in the age when Lambda solves the same problem way more efficiently. No, Lambda was not an option at all and it didn't appear anywhere in the test.</li>

In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-get-all-aws-certifications-asia-wong-chun-yin-cyrus-%E9%BB%83%E4%BF%8A%E5%BD%A5-">this other write-up on LinkedIn</a> Wong Chun Yin explained how to get all 5 AWS Certifications in Asia. Below, a couple of great hints for the SA - Associate.

    First of all, associate certifications are not hard, and if you have a chance to take the AWS training, then you just need to concentrate on reading the training slides is more than enough! Remember to read the details explanation under the slides. Good understanding of VPC and IAM is important for all associate exams.

Dan-Claudiu Dragos <a href="http://cloudacademy.com/community/passed-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-with-the-7-days-trial-by-cloud-academy-t290/">shared his experience here</a> on how he prepared for the AWS Solutions Architect Certifications in 7 days and succesfully passed it.

I'd like to share my experience of getting AWS CSA(A) certified with Cloud Academy:
 
<b>The background:</b><br>

<ul>
 <li>I have registered my personal AWS account late 2014 and still do not do much with it. Without a professional motivator this is actually a dead end, more like buying a book and never reading it.
 </li>
<li>Mid-2015 I started doing DevOps work for a customer of my employer. They have a 1000+ node AWS environment that was fully configured with multiple VPCs, VPN access, IAM groups and the like. That become my playground and was the actual game changer, the single big detail that made the difference, certification-wise.</li>
</ul>
<br>
 
<b>The process:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Late April 2016 I have found the r/sysadmin (reddit) message with one month promotion by Cloud Academy. At that point I did not know anything about the AWS certifications but the seed got planted. I found the message a bit late, though, when the seats were already filled up, so did not register at that time.</li>
<li>During the first week or so afterwards I was a bit confused, did not know what path to take. My first intention was to go to the Sysops cert but then I read on the Cloud Academy page that there is a big overlap with the "simpler" Architecture certification.</li>
<li>By looking around I have found some course recordings from 2 years ago (don't ask) and listened to them for a total of 14 to 16 hours (not sure about this detail). They helped me get in the right mood to start doing tests, quizes, practice stuff...</li>
<li>Mid-May, I register myself with Cloud Academy and get the 7 days trial. Well, I did the best out of that - my public profile says I have completed 1600+ quizes and got 35,000+ karma during that time. I have taken every quiz from the then AWS CSA(A) learning path multiple times until I got my score above 90%. The EC2/EBS quizes were quite easy, actually, with my experience; the S3 and IAM ones were average and Cloud Academy helped me fill in many blanks in that area. The database ones (DynamoDB and RDS) were the hardest and I had to open a lab to see how things were done and what concepts were important.</li>
<li>In the last 3 days of the trial I have taken the 150+ questions exam at the end of the learning path and got 75% on the first try. I have taken it 2 or 3 more times, but as I started to remember questions I no longer considered it that useful to figure out what I still don't know.</li>
<li>By that time I have also started to read white papers from Amazon on topics that were lightly touched by Cloud Academy, e.g. EBS RAID configurations and Route 53 special record types, health checks and failovers.</li>
<li>I also got 4 apps from the Google Play Store, I found "AWS Architect - Associate" and "Cloud Pros- AWS Certified Arch" best. At that point I was already above the 90% passing threshold, though, and could not find many questions online I could not provide the expected correct answer to.</li>
<li>I have also taken the practice exam from Amazon (a $20 cost). Please note that the questions do not change so taking it once and taking photos of the screen really helps on figuring out the failed questions. Nevertheless, I got 90% and scheduled myself a slot for "the real thing".</li>
<li>May 27th - I went to the testing center and passed the AWS CSA(A) exam with 83%; I assume this is an average passing score. Amazon doesn't tell what is the failing threshold, but tells you how well you did in 4 areas (I had 80-85-90% in all of them).</li>

</ul>
<br>
 
<b>On the exam itself:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>I got one question from the sample questions and one from the practice exam; they were on the simpler side.</li>
<li>33% are "easy", in the sense that fall in the "is water wet? true/false" type - relative to the AWS concepts, though.</li>
<li>33% are "average", more like "what feels wetter, water or oil?"</li>
<li>33% are hard or even crazy, covering all sorts of service details or requiring you to provide answers in the line of Amazon recommendations regarding certain service usage.</li>
<li>About half of them are multiple answer, with no partial points given.</li>
<li>Oh, don't look for dumps, Amazon has hundreds of possible questions out of which a subset is being given for each exam, there simply is no way to pass such exam with brain dumps, so forget it.</li>
</ul>
 
<br>
That's it. I'm the number 16.891, not sure if this is small or big, or even if it matters.
